# Introduction

This repo is just a collection of scripts related to numerical methods for ODEs
and PDEs, particularly those in a class known as "Spectral Methods."

# Getting Started

All of the scripts here use Python 3, and it is recommended to use a virtual
environment to manage requirements. I.e.,

```bash

  export REPO /path/to/repo
  python3 -m venv $REPO
  source $REPO/bin/activate.sh
  pip install -r $REPO/requirements.txt

```

After this, you should be ok to simply run each script with e.g. `python3 src/
p1.py`
